##Thanks
 - The [Github Octocat](http://octodex.github.com/) is property of Github, and the usage of the various Octocat images in this game are intended solely for the entertainment of four-year-olds. I'm happy to change the images used upon request.
 - [sherzberg](https://github.com/sherzberg) for testing.
 - Thanks to David Walsh for a nice tutorial on [flipping with CSS](http://davidwalsh.name/css-flip).
 - [Sprite Cow](http://www.spritecow.com/) saved me a lot of time trying to figure out the coordinates for all of the images on my sprite sheet.
 - [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/) was used to make my sprite sheet and resolve some transparency issues with the source image.
 - [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) was used to warn users trying to access with incompatible browsers.
